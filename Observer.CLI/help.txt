Observer.CLI supports two types of syntax:  Path syntax and Elemnt syntax.

Path syntax is the recommended way to download a series or a category along with it's related data.
For example, using the series path, you can specify one or more series identifiers to download series metadata, observations, categories, etc. for those series.
Using the category path, you can specify a category identifier and download child categories, series metadata, observations, category tags, etc. for that category.

Use Element syntax to download specific Fred elements.  Element syntax supports some of the same options as Path syntax however it is intended to allow more
granular control over which data items are downloaded.

=============================================
--- Usage ---

Regardless of which syntax is used, the first argument provided to Observer must be the name of a data provider, --config, or --help.  

Examples:
obs Fred
obs --config
obs --help
The only data provider supported at this time is Fred.

=============================================
--- Path syntax ---

obs fred path category <categoryID> [SERIES] [DISC] [CHILDCAT] [SERIESTAGS] [CATTAGS] [RELCAT] [REL] [RELDATE] [SOURCE] [OBS] [RECURSE]

obs fred path series <seriesID>[,seriesID...] [DISC] [SERIESCAT] [CHILDCAT] [SERIESTAGS] [CATTAGS] [RELCAT] [REL] [RELDATE] [SOURCE] [OBS] 


-- Arguments:
SERIES			Applies to category path only.  Downloads series metadata for each series in the category.
DISC			If specified, series marked as discontinued will be downloaded.
SERIESCAT 		Applies to series path only.
CHILDCAT 		Downloads child categores of a supplied category ID, or child categories of the category of a supplied series ID.
SERIESTAG		Downloads series tags for any downloaded series
CATTAG			Downloads category tags for any downloaded category
RELCAT			Downloads related categories for any downloaded category	
REL				Downloads releases for any downloaded series
RELDATE 		Downloads release dates for any downloaded release
SOURCE			Downloads source for any downloaded release
OBS 			Downloads observations for any downloaded series
RECURSE 		Applies to category path only.  CHILDCAT argument must also be provided. Recurse child categores and download all elements per the supplied arguments.

When specifying multple seriesIDs, seperate each seriesID with a comma and do not embed spaces.


Examples:

obs fred path category 130 series childcat obs recurse

The above command will download series metadata and child categores for series and categories that are children of category 130.  Observations for 
each series will also be downloaded.  Note that if the SERIES argument is not provided than other dependant arguments such as SERIESTAGS and OBS make
no sense and have no effect.

obs fred path series 


Vintage dates are always downloaded when observations are downloaded.  There is no API to download vintage dates independently. 
Observations are updated using the last date stored in the local database.  


=============================================
--- Element syntax ---

Element syntax requires the the type of data element must be specified after the provider name.  The four shown below are supported:

obs fred [<category> | <release> | <series> | <source>]

Each element type argument supports optional arguments as shown:

obs fred category [children | related | series | tags] <cateogryID>[,categoryID..]

obs fred release [dates | series | sources <releaseID>[,releaseID]] [releaseID[,releaseID...]]

obs fred series [categories | release | tags | observations] <seriesID>[,seriesID...]

obs fred source [releases <sourceID>[,sourceID...]] [sourceID[,sourceID...]]

When specifying multple identifiers, seperate each identifier with a comma and do not embed spaces.

Vintage dates are always downloaded when observations are downloaded.  There is no API to download vintage dates independently. 
Observations are updated using the last date stored in the local database.  
=============================================
--- Configuration information ---

obs --config [updatedb]

--config displays version information and confirms the database schema is up to date.
Use the updatedb argument to create the database or update the schema.
=============================================
--- Help ---
obs --help

Displays this help text.
